# Privacy Policy for ClearHead

**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

ClearHead is built with your privacy as the top priority. This is your personal journal, and we believe your thoughts should stay private.

## Data Storage

**Everything stays on your device.** All your journal entries, settings, and personal information are stored locally on your iPhone or iPad using your device's secure storage. We do not have servers that store your journal entries, and we cannot access your journal content.

## What We Collect

ClearHead collects and stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

- Your name (if you choose to provide it for personalized greetings)
- Your journal entries (text and voice recordings)
- Your reminder settings (time, days, preferences)
- Entry metadata (dates, tags, sentiment analysis)

**None of this data is uploaded to our servers or shared with anyone.**

## Third-Party Services

To provide certain features, ClearHead uses the following third-party services:

### OpenAI
- **Used for:** Voice transcription (Whisper API), AI insights, and pattern analysis
- **What's sent:** Voice recordings for transcription, and journal entry text for analysis
- **Data retention:** OpenAI processes your data but does not store it on their servers for training or other purposes
- **Privacy policy:** https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy

### ElevenLabs
- **Used for:** Voice Coach feature (text-to-speech)
- **What's sent:** AI-generated coaching questions (not your journal entries)
- **Data retention:** ElevenLabs processes audio generation requests but does not store your data

**Important:** Only the specific content needed for these features is sent to third-party services. Your full journal remains private on your device.

## What We Don't Do

- ❌ We don't upload your journal entries to the cloud
- ❌ We don't sell your data to advertisers or third parties
- ❌ We don't track your usage for analytics or marketing
- ❌ We don't share your data with anyone except the services listed above (and only when you use those specific features)
- ❌ We don't require an account or login
- ❌ We don't use your entries to train AI models

## Your Control

You have complete control over your data:

- **Export:** You can export all your entries at any time from Settings
- **Delete:** You can delete individual entries or all entries at any time
- **Local only:** Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly use AI-powered features

## Notifications

If you enable journal reminders, ClearHead will use your device's notification system. These are local notifications scheduled on your device - no data is sent to external servers for notifications.

## Children's Privacy

ClearHead does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not use this app.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

**Bottom line:** Your journal is yours. We store everything locally on your device, we don't sell your data, and we only use trusted AI services (OpenAI, ElevenLabs) when you explicitly use features that require them.
